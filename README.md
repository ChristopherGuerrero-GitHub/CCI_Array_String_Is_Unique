# CCI_Array_String_Is_Unique
Initialize project CCI - String is Unique

This program is a solution toward CCI book problem of checking for unique strings. Use a boolean array
of size 128 to represent 128 unique ASCII characters. Turn each element in the array to True if a unique
character is found. If another character is encountered that already the flag was True for that particular
unique character then the result should return False to indicate that the string input did not contain
all unique characters.
